The syntax for the calloc function is as follows: ptr = (castType*)calloc(n, size); where:

ptr is a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block
castType is the type to which the pointer should be cast
n is the number of elements to be allocated and size is the size of each element.
realloc function changes the size of the memory block pointed to by a previously allocated memory block. The function takes two arguments: a pointer to the previously allocated memory block, and the new size of the memory block.

The syntax for the realloc function is as follows: ptr = realloc(ptr, newSize); where:

ptr is a pointer to the previously allocated memory block
newSize is the new size of the memory block
Both calloc and realloc functions return a pointer to the allocated memory block. If the memory allocation fails, both functions return a NULL pointer.

Here's an example of the calloc function:
